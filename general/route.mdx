## How Router Works

The Chat Completion now includes a routing feature, designed to enhance reliability and continuity in API interactions. This feature ensures that if the primary model fails or is unavailable, the request is automatically routed to a pre-defined fallback model. This document explains the routing functionality, its advantages, and how to implement it effectively.

### Overview

Routing in the OpenAI Chat Completion API serves as a fail-safe mechanism. When a request is made to a specific model and that model is unable to respond (due to unavailability, overload, or other issues), the API automatically redirects the request to a secondary, fallback model. This ensures continuity and reduces the likelihood of service interruptions.

### Benefits of Routing
- <b>Enhanced Reliability</b>: Routing provides a backup option, ensuring that requests are handled even if the primary model is unavailable.
- <b>Seamless User Experience</b>: It minimizes disruptions, maintaining a smooth and consistent user experience.
- <b>Flexibility in Model Usage</b>: Allows for more flexibility in using various models, as fallback options are readily available
